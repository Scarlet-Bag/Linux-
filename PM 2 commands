So to start the process, we should be in our source code directory. And in that, we should have the .js files, which help us to start the process in Nodejs.

pm2 start tla.js

Now let’s suppose you have to start the service or process with a particular name, then use the –name option with pm2.

$ pm2 start tla.js --name TLA-PROCESS

$ pm2 start all

$ pm2 stop all
