Step 1:
Go to /etc/apache2/conf/httpd.conf
Here find the domain or subdomain and remove the '#" sign in front of the two paths as seen below.
/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/username/domainname.com/*.conf
/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/username/domainname.com/*.conf

Step 2 after removing the hash sign, proxy becomes active.
Step3 Copy the path you just removed the hash and make a directory same as that
command for it :mkdir -p /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/username/domainname
mkdir -p /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/username/domainname
step4 After you make the folder add the new folder add a new file in both the folder named as proxy.conf

(make sure the path becomes as /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/username/domainname/proxy.conf and /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/username/domainname/proxy.conf)
Step 5 add a code in first file in /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/username/domainname/proxy.conf
vi proxy.conf

# This is for normal requests
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:3001/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:3001/

and save it.Please note here port used is 3001

Step6 add the code in /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/username/domainname/proxy.conf
vi proxy.conf

SSLProxyEngine On
ProxyPreserveHost On
ProxyRequests Off


# This is for normal requests
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:3001/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:3001/

and save.

Step7 : httpd -t 
This command checks syntax
Step8:restart apache by the command as 
systemctl restart httpd
