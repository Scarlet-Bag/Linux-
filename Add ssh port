sudo systemctl status firewalld
If itâ€™s active, allow the new port (e.g., 2222):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2222/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
âœ… Verify:
Run sudo firewall-cmd --list-all to confirm the new port is open.

3. Edit SSH Configuration File
Open the SSH config:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Find this line:

bash
Copy
Edit
#Port 22
Change it to (uncomment and modify):

bash
Copy
Edit
Port 2222
ðŸ’¡ You can also allow both ports temporarily for testing:

bash
Copy
Edit
Port 22
Port 2222
Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, then Ctrl+X).

4. Restart the SSH Service
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart sshd
5. Test SSH on the New Port
From another terminal or system, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -p 2222 youruser@yourserver_ip
Make sure it works before closing your current session.

6. (Optional) Disable Old Port After Testing
Once you confirm the new port works:

Remove port 22 from firewalld:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=22/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
Remove or comment out Port 22 in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

Then restart SSH again:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart sshd
ðŸ›‘ WHM Users Note:
If you're using WHM, be aware that WHM may revert network/SSH changes during updates or restarts. Always keep emergency console access (e.g., IPMI, KVM) available in case of lockout.

Let me know the port you're planning to use, and I can help check if it's safe or already in use.
